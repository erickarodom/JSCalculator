These are the highlights of this project: 
- HTML, CSS scaffolding on this project is basic and quick.
- The JavaScript for this project required me to stretch my JS logic muscles, easily the best part of this project:
 - breaking down the functionality into digestible pieces.
 - while building the smaller pieces my understanding of functions, function scope, data type selection, and using loops was greatly enhanced!
